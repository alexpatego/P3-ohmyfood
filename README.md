The goal of the project was the use some CSS animations to do the animations of the pages and use SASS to write the CSS and variables for the project.

It was also my first project using Git and Github as a tool to follow my project and to make change on it. 

Overall the goal of the project was to learn how to create a Front-End environnement and make it work only using CSS and SCSS and not using JS. 

Technologies used: HTML, CSS, SCSS, Git, PostCSS, Autoprefixer and CSSNano.
